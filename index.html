    <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Since the creation of large language models (LLMs), their use in various fields, such as writing and medicine, has increased. In this overview, we will focus on programming. Professionals have been concerned about the possibility of being replaced by AI and about how future generations will learn to code 
(<a href="https://dobetter.esade.edu/en/programming-LLMs" target="_blank">Esade DoBetter</a>), 
And we hope. This website serves as a testament to what a beginner can achieve in coding with the help of a tool like ChatGPT (along with a lot of trial and error), highlighting the positives and negatives of using AI in programming from an outsider’s perspective.

  <section id="Positives">
    <h2>Positives AI in Programming</h2>
   <p>
      Artificial Intelligence for developers is revolutionizing software development by automating coding, bug fixing, and optimization 
(<a href="https://techaipulse.com/artificial-intelligence-for-programmers/#How_AI_is_Changing_Programming" target="_blank">Tech AI Pulse</a>). 
AI-powered tools help developers write efficient code, detect errors, and streamline operations. From AI-powered code assistants to machine learning systems, programmers now have access to advanced solutions that improve productivity. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, AI simplifies complex tasks and increases development speed. AI coding assistants analyze large amounts of code to make accurate recommendations.
</p>


      <p>They help detect errors before execution. Troubleshooting becomes faster with AI-powered insights. These tools improve code design, making applications more efficient. Developers experience fewer runtime errors and improved performance.AI can't replace human creativity, but it's a game-changer for both beginners and experienced developers. As AI continues to evolve, embracing these tools will be essential for staying competitive in the rapidly changing technology industry.</p>

<section id="Negatives">
  <h2>Negatives of AI in Programming</h2> 

<p>
AI can be pretty helpful when it comes to writing, studying, or just getting a quick answer. But it’s not something you can fully trust all the time. One of the biggest issues is that it can give you wrong information and still sound confident 
(<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/00472875231212996" target="_blank">SAGE Journals</a>). 
Sometimes, it just leaves out important details, mixes up facts, or even makes stuff up completely. If someone just takes it without checking, then that can lead to a lot of confusion.This can happen in both my personal experience and in programming,
</p>

 <p>The problem is that AI doesn’t understand things like people do. It doesn’t know what’s true or false; it just puts words together that seem like they make sense based on stuff it’s seen before. So basically, it’s guessing what a good answer might sound like, not giving you a correct one. That’s why it’s risky to rely on it too much. You could stop thinking for yourself or forget how to figure things out on your own. Even when it gives the right answer, it doesn’t always explain the reason behind it, which is important if you want to understand something.</p>

<p>
A study was done by the BBC, and it tested how AI tools like ChatGPT handled questions about current news 
(<a href="https://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=1340355&p=9880574" target="_blank">University of Maryland Library Guide</a>). 
They asked 100 questions and found that more than half of the answers had mistakes. Some were just flat-out wrong or included fake quotes that sounded real. What’s worse is that the AI still sounded sure of itself, even when it was giving false information. People started losing trust, especially when the errors were obvious or closely tied to the main topic. It showed that once AI gives even one wrong detail, it makes you question everything else it says. This can relate to programming as in it giving wrong code that can take minutes to hours to decode.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>AI helped me not just by writing code, but by teaching me how to understand it. I now feel more confident editing and improving simple websites.</p>
