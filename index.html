  <section id="Introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This project explores how AI tools can support beginners in programming. I used tools like ChatGPT to help write and understand code while building this very site.</p>

  <section id="Positives">
    <h2>Positives AI in Programming</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Explains code and answers questions.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub Copilot:</strong> Auto-suggests code inside editors like VS Code.</li>
      <li><strong>Codeium:</strong> Free alternative for code completions.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Negatives of AI in Programming</h2> 

  <p>AI can be pretty helpful when it comes to writing, studying, or just getting a quick answer. But it’s not something you can fully trust all the time. One of the biggest issues is that it can provide you wrong information and still sound confident. Sometimes, it just leaves out important details, mixes up facts, or even makes stuff up completely. If someone just takes it without checking, then that can lead to a lot of confusion. This can happen in both my personal experience and in programming.</p>

 <p>The problem is that AI doesn’t understand things like people do. It doesn’t know what’s true or false; it just puts words together that seem like they make sense based on stuff it’s seen before. So basically, it’s guessing what a good answer might sound like, not giving you a correct one. That’s why it’s risky to rely on it too much. You could stop thinking for yourself or forget how to figure things out on your own. Even when it gives the right answer, it doesn’t always explain the reason behind it, which is important if you want to understand something.</p>

  <p>A study was done by the BBC, and it tested how AI tools like ChatGPT handled questions about current news. They asked 100 questions and found that more than half of the answers had mistakes. Some were just flat-out wrong or included fake quotes that sounded real. What’s worse is that the AI still sounded sure of itself, even when it was giving false information. People started losing trust, especially when the errors were obvious or closely tied to the main topic. It showed that once AI gives even one wrong detail, it makes you question everything else it says. This can relate to programing as in it giving wrong code that can take minutes to hours to decode. </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>AI helped me not just by writing code, but by teaching me how to understand it. I now feel more confident editing and improving simple websites.</p>
